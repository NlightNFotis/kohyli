                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">Vivliopoleio Kohyli was born from a lifelong love of stories. Our founder, Fotis, grew up in a small Greek village, where his happiest days were spent with his nose buried in a book. He dreamed of one day sharing his passion with the world, and so, Vivliopoleio Kohyli was born.</p>
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">Fotis envisioned a place where people could escape the everyday and lose themselves in the magic of a good book. A place where the smell of old paper and fresh coffee would mingle in the air, and where the only sound would be the gentle turning of pages.</p>
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-slate-600 mb-6">Today, Vivliopoleio Kohyli is that place. A cozy, welcoming bookstore where you can find your next great adventure, or simply a quiet corner to read and relax. We hope you'll visit us soon and become a part of our story.</p>
