# kohyli

E-shop website built using Python/FastAPI as a backend, TypeScript/React as a frontend.

To run the backend: `cd backend && just run-dev`

To run the frontend: `cd frontend && just build-preview`.

Both of these need to be running, then you can open the link to the frontend to
observe the website:
